# opensignalsreader
Python package to read OpenSignals (r)evolution files and automatic sensor data conversion for BITalino (r)evolution sensor data.

### Examples & How to Use this Package
This package comes with the OpenSignalsReader class to facilitate the import sensor signals from OpenSignals (r)evolution acquisition and the metadata of the respective acquisition. The examples below demonstrate how to use this class to load OpenSignals files, access signals, access metadata, and how to plot the imported sensor data.

#### Reading OpenSignals Files
Import OpenSignalsReader class and read OpenSignals file ('SampleECG.txt').
```python
# Import OpenSignalsReader
from opensignalsreader import OpenSignalsReader

# Read OpenSignals file
acq = OpenSignalsReader('SampleECG.txt')
```

#### Accessing Sensor Data
Objects of the OpenSignalsReader class store raw digital sensor values and additionally their conversion into the sensor's original physical units (e.g. ECG -> mV). Use the `OpenSignalsReader.raw()` and the `OpenSignalsReader.signal()` methods to access the signals.

Accessing individual sensor data (this method returns data in a NumPy array):
```python
# Access single sensor signal using the sensor's channel number
acq.raw(2)
acq.signal(2)

# Access single sensor signal using the sensor's label
acq.raw('ECG')
acq.signal('ECG')
```

Accessing multiple sensor data (this method returns data in a dictionary with the sensor labels as keys):
```python
# Access multiple sensor signals using the channel numbers (here: channel 1 & 2)
acq.raw([1,2])
acq.signal([1,2])

# Access multiple sensor signals using the sensor labels (here: channel 1 & 2)
acq.raw(['ECG', 'EEG'])
acq.signal(['ECG', 'EEG'])
```

#### Plotting Sensor Data
The OpenSignalsReader class comes with plotting features as shown below.

Read OpenSignals file and plot all signals.
```python
# Read OpenSignals file and plot all signals
acq = OpenSignalsReader('SampleECG.txt', show=True)

# Read OpenSignals file and plot all raw signals.
acq = OpenSignalsReader('SampleECG.txt', show=True, raw=True)
```

Alternatively, select the individual signals you want to plot using the `OpenSignalsReader.plot()` and the signal sensor label or channel number.
```python
# Plot ECG signal using the channel number
acq.plot('ECG')

# Plot ECG signal using the sensor label
acq.plot(2)

# Plotting multiple signals using the channel number
acq.plot(['ECG', 'EMG'])

# Plotting multiple signals using the sensor label
acq.plot([1, 2])
```
To plot the raw signals set the `raw` parameter to `True`.
```python
# Plot raw ECG data
acq.plot('ECG', raw=True)
```

### BITalino (r)evolution Transfer Functions
This package includes the _bitalino_transfer_functions_ module which contains all available transfer functions of the current BITalino (r)evolution sensors. It is used by the _OpenSignalsReader_ class to convert raw signal samples imported from OpenSignals files into their original units.

This package can also be useful if you want to convert sensor signals within your own software when not importing signals from the OpenSignals files.

BITalino sample series can be converted into their original units using the sensor's transfer function. See below how to use the functions of the _bitalino_ module on the example of the ECG sensor.
```python
import numpy as np
from opensignalsreader.bitalino_transfer_functions import ecg
signal = np.loadtxt('SampleECG.txt', 'r')[:, -1]

# Convert signal to mV (10-bit resolution as default resolution)
ecg_signal = ecg(signal)

# Convert signal acquired with 6-bit sampling resolution
ecg_signal = ecg(signal, 6)
```
